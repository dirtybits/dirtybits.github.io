								<p><h3>{ What is Conceal? }</h3>
								Conceal is a privacy protected digital cash system. It is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted parties. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with each other over a secure peer-to-peer network. Conceal is an open source scalability-focused, untraceable, secure, and fungible cryptocurrency using CryptoNote (Masari's CN Fast variant). The decentralised network supports encrypted messages and deposits with interest.</p>

								<h3>{ DEPOSITS }</h3>
									<p>Most cryptocurrency sit in wallets or cold storage, failing to generate any additional income beyond currency appreciation.
										With the Conceal Deposit facility, you can earn as much as an additional 4% per annum. All you need is the Conceal GUI Wallet to get started.<br /><br />
										Min deposit: 1 coin<br />
										Max term: 262,800 blocks, 12 months = 1 year<br />									
										Min term: 21,900 blocks, 1 month<br />
										Interest rate: 4% per year (max term)<br />									
										Min interest rate: 0.333333333% per month (min term)<br /><br />
									</p>

									<h3>{ SECURE MESSAGING }</h3>
									<p>Secure your confidentiality with messaging over an encrypted P2P network, secure communications and encrypted self destructive messages. 
									Send anonymous encrypted messages over the decentralized blockchain and avoid censorship and tracking.<br />
									
									<h4>FEES</h4>	
									Send Permanent Message: 0.000010 CCX + (0.000010 per char)<br />

								<h2 class="major">FEATURES</h2>
								<p>
									<h3>{ Private }</h3>
Conceal uses ring signatures and one-time addresses for truly anonymous payments.<br /><br />

<h3>{ Untraceable }</h3>
Conceal's transactions can't be linked between the sender and the recipient.<br /><br />

<h3>{ Decentralised }</h3>
Conceal follows Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision of decentralised, trustless cryptocurrency, i.e. a secure digital cash operated by a network of users. Transactions are confirmed by distributed consensus, and then recorded on the blockchain immutably. Third-parties do not need to be trusted to keep your money safe<br /><br />

<h3>{ Fungible }</h3>
Conceal is truly fungible, thanks to built-in privacy features. Just like cash, all coins are equal, changeable. It is extremely unlikely that a coin will ever be blacklisted by any party due to its association in previous transactions<br /><br />

<h3>{ Scalable }</h3>
Future scalability initiatives with Uncle Mining and Blocktree protocols<br /><br />

<h3>{ Community Developed }</h3>
Developed and funded by community volunteers<br /><br />

<h3>{ Simple }</h3>
Cross-platform supported and easy to use<br /><br />

<h3>{ Protected Proof Of Work }</h3>
PoW hash function is designed for egalitarian CPU & GPU mining and ASIC Resistance<br /><br />

								<h2 class="major">Mining</h2>

								<p><h3>{ Block Rewards }</h3>

									Conceal's block reward model uses an innovate approach. The block reward starts small and get bigger with time as the blockchain network grows, so does the cost of mining. At the beginning every network have a small number of transactions per day and the blockchain is still a small file but with time the size will go up and the effort to keep it running will be bigger. More miners will be needed to keep it running sound and safe. To reward properly this mining effort we will start with 5 CCX per block and raise it by 0.25 CCX every month until we reach 20 CCX per block (capped - max reward in 5 years).</p>
